# TextToEmotionalSpeech_UG_Project

Short Intro of how I started working on this project

During my final year in my Under graduation, I was so interested in making the computers and machines behave like humans. So as a starter I along with my friend started working on this project on December,2017 and finished the project on February,2018 (a period of 3 months roughly) with lots of fun and enjoyment. I had all the codes, documents and other files related to the project in my hard disk. Now I am uploading everything in Github to share with you all so that you guys can enjoy and have fun looking at my cool fun simple project.
